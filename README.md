# Gitbook Markdown Viewer
This Vue.js webapp is a simple reader for Markdown files generated using [Gitbook](https://www.gitbook.com).

To use this viewer you will need a Github Repository  which contains:
- Markdown files as generated by Gitbook via the inbuilt Github integration
- A `package.json` file at the repository root folder. This will allow us to use `npm` or `yarn` to pull down the Markdown document content and set it as a frontend dependency.

For demonstration, this project has already installed the [converse-docs](https://github.com/garrethpxy/converse-docs) package dependency, which contains the Product Documentation for TAIGER Converse.
